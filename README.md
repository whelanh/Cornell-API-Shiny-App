# Cornell-API-Shiny-App
This R Shiny code displays a list of birds you haven't seen.  You can select different areas and also different "seen" lists (e.g., ABA area, World, ABA year etc.).  This requires updating csv files in the "data" directory when you add seen birds.  To run, you will need to supply your own Cornell API 2.0 key.
